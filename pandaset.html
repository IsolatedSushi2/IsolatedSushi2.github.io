							  <p>
								PandaSet is the result of a collaberation between Scale AI and Hesai.
								It is the first open-source AV dataset available for both academic and commercial use, PandaSet combines Hesai's best-in-class LiDAR sensors with Scale AI's high-quality data annotation.
								PandaSet features data collected using a forward-facing LiDAR with image-like resolution (PandarGT) as well as a mechanical spinning LiDAR (Pandar64).
								The collected data was annotated with a combination of cuboid and segmentation annotation (Scale 3D Sensor Fusion Segmentation).
							  </p>
							  <p>
								  The data is <a href="https://pandaset.org/#data-collection">collected</a> using a specialised car as shown below.

								In order to describe this project, a short video is created to showcase the main features. Additionally, some more detail is given below, together with some GIFS. Note that these GIFS do have a lower image quality.

								<h2 class="major">LiDaR Point Cloud</h2>
								<p>
							     A typical lidar sensor emits pulsed light waves from a laser into the environment.
								 These pulses bounce off surrounding objects and return to the sensor.
								 The sensor uses the time it took for each pulse to return to the sensor to calculate the distance it traveled.
								 Repeating this process millions of times per second creates a precise, real-time 3D map of the environment. 
								 This map can be visualised in a big point clound. Currently, around 3 million points are visualised.

								<h2 class="major">Time Stamps</h2>
								<p>
								  The dataset contains several trips, whilst each trip consists of around 80 timestamps.
								  These timestamps are roughly a few seconds apart, This means that the car travels a few hundred meters.
								  When recording, the car drives through a street, using its lidar sensors and cameras.
								  We can visualise its trajectory trough the coloured line.
								  The pointclouds can be visualised per timestamp instead of all of them combined.

								<h2 class="major">Colour projection</h2>
								<p>
								Besides the lidar sensors, the car also records the images around itself.
								With this information we can colorize the points in the pointcloud.
								We do this by projecting the points from world space to image space, and reading the colour from the pixels.
								By doing this for all the cameras, we can get a accurate colorization of the environment.

								<h2 class="major">Segmentation</h2>
								<p>
									The dataset also provides a segmentation.
									This means that every point in the pointcloud is labeled to be a certain class.
									For example, classes could be: cars, buildings, road markings et cetera.
									This is incredibly useful when training classifiers for distinguishing cars from other objects, since it allows for supervised machine learning. This segmentation can also be used for creating masks. That way we can disable the visualisation for some classes entirely.
									This yields a less cluttered view of the environment.
									On the other hand, it could be used to create a less noisy environment when training classifiers.
									This could be useful in the early stages of development, incrementally adding more objects to the environment.
